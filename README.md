### Introduction 
The concept behind Shaboy draws inspiration from gaming consoles that dominated the 90s era. Imagine a console where a small chip can be inserted to access thousands of games. Why not create a similar experience on web3? Shaboy emerged from this idea and is crafted to evoke the nostalgic feel of the 90s.
